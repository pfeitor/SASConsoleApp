SASConsoleApp
=============

C# - Run SAS code directly from exe and return exit code for use.

In case no SAS EG installed and this app can submit SAS code to server for execution, also return exit code (0 - success; 4 - errors). 

The error code can then be used as input of other application (eg. Control-M)
